Custom License for the Adaptive Contradiction Induction Resolution Engine (ACIR Engine): Legal Analysis and Robust Model License
Introduction
The Adaptive Contradiction Induction Resolution Engine (ACIR Engine) is a sophisticated creation that necessitates a highly controlled and legally robust license. The goals for its licensing regime are multifaceted and stringent: absolute prohibition of use and publication without explicit, case-by-case consent; the possibility of a seamless, liability-limiting transition to a CC0 license in the future; explicit waivers supporting such a transition; advance non-enforcement commitments; a robust fallback for moral rights; and structural clarity, copy-paste-readiness, and international enforceability.

This report analyzes the legal precedents, best practices, and regulatory and drafting requirements needed to build such a license. It explores all relevant aspects: prohibition language, transition mechanisms, limitations of liability, waivers (including those relating to moral rights), non-enforcement clauses, international contract law standards, and legal formatting. It integrates up-to-date guidance, statutory models, and instructive comparables from proprietary and open licenses, with inline references throughout. The concluding model license is structured and sectioned per your requirements, using legal best practices for clarity and enforceability across jurisdictions, as drawn from the cited literature and contracts.

1. Principles of Custom License Drafting for Proprietary Software
1.1 Overview and Rationale
Custom licensing is essential whenever a creator’s intent falls outside the boundaries of typical “off-the-shelf” or standard open-source arrangements. By constructing a license to your unique requirements, you tightly regulate who may use, publish, or modify the software and how they may do so. Custom terms are standard in the software sector where strategic control is imperative, such as for proprietary, pre-commercial, or highly sensitive tools2.

1.2 Key Clauses in Custom Licenses
A typical custom license, especially scripted for a proprietary engine, should include:

Explicit grant or denial of permission to use, publish, copy, or distribute (with or without limitations).

Definitions to clarify what constitutes ‘use,’ ‘publication,’ and ‘consent.’

Transition clauses to allow planned relicensing, including to permissive (e.g., CC0) or public domain.

Liability disclaimers and warranty waivers—particularly crucial in highly technical or experimental software.

Additional waivers (such as for moral rights or future claims to maximize the effectiveness of a CC0 transition).

Pre-commitment to non-enforcement in specific contexts.

Fallback or residual licensing to support the enforceability of rights (e.g., where moral rights cannot be waived by statute in certain countries).

Jurisdiction, choice of law, and forum selection for cross-border enforceability4.

2. Use and Publication Prohibition Clauses
2.1 Strict Controls on Use and Publication
Absolute prohibition of use and publication without explicit permission is possible and widely used in proprietary software licensing regimes. This approach is universally enforceable under copyright law; indeed, the absence of a license is customarily interpreted as ‘all rights reserved’—no-use, no-publication, no-derivatives. A well-drafted prohibition clause not only clarifies the exclusion of all implied licenses but also sets out mechanisms for seeking and granting specific permissions810.

Sample restriction clause approaches include:

“No use, publication, reproduction, distribution, or display of the ACIR Engine, in whole or in part, is permitted without the Licensor’s explicit, written advance consent for each instance.”

“Any and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved; no implied rights or licenses are created.”

This approach matches the highest standard of protection under international copyright conventions (Berne, TRIPS), obligating users to secure explicit licenses prior to any act of use or distribution5.

2.2 Prohibition Clauses in Practice
Widely referenced proprietary license agreements and court-enforced cases (notably Blizzard v. MDY for anti-bot prohibitions and similar) demonstrate that unique and absolute prohibitions of all use, reverse engineering, publication, or exploitation, except as explicitly authorized, are not only legally valid but routinely upheld in court.

3. Mechanisms for Seamless Transition to a CC0 License
3.1 Need for Future-Proof Transition
A common strategic problem for proprietary creators is retaining the possibility to release a work into the public domain or under a maximally permissive license in the future, without the risk of unintended interim use or liability. Proactive planning for a “transition” or “relicensing” event must be expressed in the license, spelling out:

The conditions under which the transition occurs,

The legal effect of the transition (including liability waivers and terminations),

The irrevocable dedication to public domain rights for all users post-transition, and

The application of fallback rights and waivers where CC0 cannot operate fully, e.g., due to moral rights rules.

3.2 Legal Basis for Transition
License transition mechanisms have clear precedents in “dual-licensing” (e.g., MySQL model), Commons Clause overlays, and stepwise public domain dedications. The license must specify that, upon a declared event (e.g., written, signed notice by the licensor), all prior restrictions are removed and the ACIR Engine is henceforth subject exclusively to the terms of CC0—with explicit incorporation of liability waivers and moral rights fallback provisions as required by law4.

CC0’s legal code itself acknowledges the need for such fallback licenses and waivers for copyright, neighboring rights, and moral rights to the maximum extent permitted by law.

3.3 Preventing Unintended Expansion of Rights
When transitioning to CC0, it’s important to limit any interpreted expansion of liability or enforceability. This is achieved via:

Explicit liability limitation in the transition clause.

Clear incorporation of all necessary waivers (warranty, title, etc.) to complement CC0 (see Section 4).

Advance pre-commitment to non-enforcement, ensuring no post-transition reassertion of rights by the original rightsholder contrary to the CC0 intent.

4. Liability Limitation and Disclaimer Clauses
4.1 General Principles
Limitation of liability clauses are a near-universal feature in software licenses, often regarded as among the most crucial terms in the agreement. Their main legal and commercial function is to:

Remove or cap monetary or other liability for the licensor in relation to the use, operation, failure, inaccuracy, or any other imaginary or actual defect in the software14.

Disclaim all express and implied warranties, especially as to merchantability, fitness for a purpose, non-infringement, and title, which, if left unaddressed, could leave the licensor open to extensive unwanted claims1516.

Best practice, as evidenced in leading commercial, academic, and government EULAs, is to include both a broad disclaimer of all warranties and an explicit no-liability clause, ideally also applying after the transition to permissive or public domain dedication.

4.2 Applicability to CC0 Dedication
Creative Commons CC0 itself incorporates both disclaimers of warranty and statements of “as is” and “no responsibility” for the accuracy, suitability, or use of the work. Including such waivers in the custom license ensures alignment and completeness when transitioning to CC0, preempting claims that may otherwise arise.

5. Complementary Waivers to Support Transition to CC0
5.1 Waivers Required by CC0
CC0 is designed to achieve the maximum possible waiver of copyright, database, and neighboring rights. However, it also recognizes that the laws of some countries restrict or prohibit the waiver of certain moral rights (e.g., the European Directive on database rights, Berne Convention, etc.)17.

5.2 Pre-emptive and Supplemental Waivers
A custom license should include:

Waiver of all possible copyright, database right, and related or neighboring rights, to the fullest extent allowed by law.

Advance, explicit waiver of all moral rights that can be legally waived (e.g., in the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and others)19.

For jurisdictions where such rights cannot be waived, an irrevocable grant of an unconditional, royalty-free fallback license, matching as closely as possible the intended breadth of the CC0 dedication19.

5.3 Fallback Licensing Mechanism
Fallback licenses become crucial in international environments and ensure that, even if a formal waiver is imperfect or unlawful in a given jurisdiction, the licensee or downstream user still receives maximal rights to use, modify, and distribute the work without fear of legal reprisal. This approach is substantiated by both CC0 and practical international copyright best practices19.

6. Non-enforcement Pre-Commitment Clauses
6.1 Purpose and Function
A non-enforcement commitment is a binding promise by the licensor not to enforce its rights under certain circumstances, even if it legally could do so. This pre-commitment is often used in IP agreements to provide additional security to users or in transitional licensing frameworks22.

A well-drafted non-enforcement commitment clarifies that any failure to pursue enforcement or any explicit declaration of non-enforcement does not constitute a waiver of the licensor’s original rights unless specified—and that post-transition, the licensor irrevocably refuses to enforce any residual rights inconsistent with CC0.

6.2 Precedent and Drafting
Sample language: “The Licensor pre-commits to not enforcing, and by this document waives, any rights inconsistent with the terms of Section [Transition to CC0] upon the effective date of such transition.”

This approach is consistent with standard “non-waiver” and non-enforcement clauses routinely enforced under international contract law, and recommended by multiple legal sources22.

7. Moral Rights Waiver and Fallback License
7.1 The Nature of Moral Rights
Moral rights (droit moral) include, but are not limited to, rights of attribution and integrity (to prevent derogatory treatment or distortion of the work). Many nations (particularly in EU and certain Berne Convention signatories) treat moral rights as inalienable—i.e., they cannot be sold or waived. Others (US, UK, Canada, Australia) allow waivers and sometimes licenses17.

7.2 Waiver Where Permissible
Where law allows, a comprehensive waiver clause should be included, specifying:

Waiver of all present and future moral rights, including rights not to object to modifications, distortions, or derogatory treatments, in favor of all subsequent users, to the extent permitted by relevant national law.

References confirm such waivers are accepted and routinely executed in publishing, technology, and entertainment contracts1924.

7.3 Fallback Moral Rights License Where Necessary
In countries prohibiting waivers, the license should automatically grant an irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, unconditional, perpetual license to exercise all moral rights in the work, so far as permitted, and to not be prevented from using, modifying, or distributing the work on account of such rights. This is widely recognized as the best harmonizing method to approximate the effect of CC0 and foster global interoperability18.

8. Cross-Jurisdictional Enforceability
8.1 Importance for International Use
Given the global aspirations of many software projects, cross-jurisdictional enforceability is non-negotiable. Contracts must:

Specify the governing law (choice of law) and forum for dispute resolution, with a provision for international arbitration if litigation in local courts is unwise or uncertain12526.

Incorporate severability and fallback language so that if part of the license is found invalid or unenforceable in one country, the remainder continues in force everywhere else2527.

8.2 Best Practices
Detailed, unambiguous language—the hallmark of clear, enforceable agreements across divergent legal systems.

Explicit dispute resolution and choice-of-forum clause, referencing a jurisdiction with well-established software contract law or international arbitration.

Inclusion of international public policy exceptions for compliance with overriding statutory rules.

9. Structured Formatting for a Legal License Document
9.1 Organization for Clarity and Enforcement
Modern best practices for structuring legal instruments are clear: use section-based formatting, numbered headings, logical division, and standardized language for maximum clarity, readability, and enforcement2931.

Begin with an unmistakable title and preamble.

Include definitions up front (for terms such as ‘use,’ ‘publication,’ ‘consent,’ and others).

Use one clear section per essential clause (prohibition, transition, liability, waiver, etc.).

Where possible, directly reference or incorporate by reference the actual CC0 legal code in the transition provisions33.

End with execution/acceptance fields as required.

7. INCORPORATION OF CC0 LEGAL CODE
7.1 CC0 LEGAL TEXT INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. Upon the License Transition Event, the full text of the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication license (available at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.en) is incorporated herein and forms the sole governing licensing terms for the Work. In the event of inconsistency between this document and CC0, the CC0 text controls and this License is deemed to the maximum degree as a complementary waiver, fallback, and clarification in support of CC0’s effective operation364.

8. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF FUTURE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS
8.1 INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE. If the Licensor designates any supplemental terms or updates upon publicly releasing the Work under CC0, such document(s) shall be incorporated by reference into this License with the same force and effect as if set forth fully herein, so far as they are not inconsistent with CC0’s “No Rights Reserved” status33.

9. JURISDICTION, GOVERNING LAW, AND CROSS-BORDER ENFORCEABILITY
9.1 CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM. Prior to the License Transition Event, this License shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction] without reference to conflict of law principles. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this License or the Work shall be resolved exclusively by mediation, arbitration, or a competent court in [Jurisdiction], as determined solely by the Licensor263.

9.2 INTERNATIONAL ENFORCEABILITY. The parties acknowledge that they intend this License to be effective and enforceable in all jurisdictions, applying the severability clause (see Section 10.1 below) to preserve validity where possible. For cross-border enforcement, this License shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the parties’ intent to reserve all rights unless and until CC0 is applied, and to ensure the enforceability of waivers, non-enforcement, and moral rights fallback mechanisms to the greatest extent allowed by law5.

10. GENERAL PROVISIONS
10.1 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this License, or its application in any circumstance, is found by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent possible, and the parties shall cooperate to give effect to the intended meaning, waivers, and operative effect of the License in any lawful form4.

10.2 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the Licensor and any person or entity in relation to the Work, and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, or statements except as otherwise expressly set out herein.

10.3 AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. No amendment or waiver to this License is effective unless made in a writing signed by the Licensor. Failure of the Licensor to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver of rights to enforce it at any time or in any similar instance23.

10.4 EXECUTION AND ACCEPTANCE. No person or entity is authorized to use or publish the Work except as explicitly set out above. Acceptance of this License, or use of the Work in any way, constitutes agreement to all terms and conditions set out herein and in the Creative Commons CC0 (after the Transition Event).

END OF LICENSE

ANALYTICAL COMMENTARY: Clause-by-Clause Review
Each section and clause is drawn directly from or inspired by the latest and strongest legal practice, as supported throughout this report:

Prohibition Clauses (Section 3): Mirroring classic “all rights reserved” and absolute restriction precedents, squarely supported by copyright law and case law, with zero implied rights provided786.

Transition to CC0 (Section 4): Follows the recommended protocol for seamless relicensing and waiver stacking for maximum future-open release, while preserving liability limitations congruent with CC0’s as-is structure11.

Liability Limitations and Waivers (Section 4.2–4.4): Modeled on best-in-class SaaS, academic, and proprietary contracts, as required by complex software licensing deals globally3414.

Waivers for CC0 and Moral Rights (Sections 4.4 and 6): Integrates CC0’s fallback licensing mechanism as well as typical moral rights waivers for maximum enforceability worldwide, supported by acknowledged practices in US, UK, Canada, Australia, and fallback licenses/policy elsewhere1718.

Non-Enforcement Commitment (Section 5): A robust, irrevocable “covenant not to sue” and pre-commitment, as repeatedly enforced in IP and contract cases and recommended by major legal advisors due to its global legal standing234.

Cross-border Jurisdiction and Choice of Law (Section 9): As supported by legal authorities and necessary for international contracts, with fallback, arbitration, and severability for broadest coverage52531.

Incorporation by Reference (Sections 7–8): Standard method for integrating, by explicit citation, the full text of CC0 and any future documents, recognized for clear legal enforcement
