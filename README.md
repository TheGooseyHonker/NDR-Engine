Infinite 3D Wave Contradictor with Complex Phasors

This extension adds frequency and phase to each input wave and tracks them as complex phasors. Waves of different frequencies are accumulated independently, and each merged phasor vector emits a scaled contradictory phasor.

===================

Infinite 3D Wave Contradictor

This module generalizes the “merged 3D wave contradictor” to handle

• A potentially infinite stream of 3-D input waves
• An unbounded stream of contradictory output waves
• Dynamic attachment of any number of wave conductors, each with its own capacity or callback


---

Overview

1. Input stream
An `Iterator` or generator that yields `(amplitude, θ, φ)` indefinitely (or until you stop it).
2. Merging
We keep a running vector sum of all Cartesian conversions of your input waves.
3. Contradiction
On each new input, we emit one (or more) “contradictory” waves = ± k × merged vector.
4. Conductors
You attach any number of conductor callbacks. Whenever we emit a contradictory wave, each conductor “receives” it (up to its capacity or logic).

Title of the Invention 

Narcissistic Dissonance Resolution Engine

Field of the Invention 

This invention relates to repeating control loops for managing states in neurons, biological or artificial, and similar systems—including systems deemed similar through correlation. It unifies neuromodulatory factors as modules into a single adaptive engine.

Background of the Invention 

Modern feedback and reinforcement-learning systems adjust behavior based only on external rewards or simple error signals. Neuroscience -- and implications found through emerging research -- teaches that distinct neuromodulators govern different aspects of state regulation: 

• GABA for rapid inhibition and reset of runaway signals
• Glutamate rapid excitation of inhibited signals 
• Serotonin (5-HT) for mood balance and baseline drive 
• Norepinephrine (NE) for broad exploration when big changes are needed 
• Acetylcholine (ACh) for focused scanning near promising solutions 
• Dopamine (DA) for learning from rewards (benefits) and updating action preferences 
• Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) for cementing (integration) 
• Phosphorylated Tau (P-tau) for pruning (disintegration)

Additionally, some brain-inspired modules are as follows: 

• Conditioning (Large Language Model artificial intelligence – simple Input feedback for complex NDR-guided behaviors) 
• Memory Log - Long Term Memory (for reflection/refinement of state regulation)

No known system ties these modulators and brain-inspired modules together in a continuous loop that measures a multi-dimensional “contradiction gap” between where an agent is currently (etiological origin/cause) and where it wants to be (teleological end/purpose), then deploys the neuromodulatory method at the right time. 

5. Summary of the Invention 
NDR Engine Summary: 
The Narcissistic Dissonance Resolution Engine works in a continuous loop to keep an agent in a desired state by measuring gaps, utilizing some of many neuromodulatory modules in sequence and/or in parallel, then prunes or cements repeated iterations of an output (based on utility).

Define the Target State: 
Call this s_target—the internal condition you want repeated (for example: alive, secure, energized, balanced).

Compute the Contradiction Gap (Dissonance): 
Measure the agent’s current state s_current and score each via your cognitive-behavioral utility function μ_C(·). 

Plug into the formula: 
Dissonance_Gap = μ_C(NDR_Output) + ( μ_C(s_target) – μ_C(s_current) ) 
• Here: 


– μ_C(s_target) is the utility of the goal state. 
– μ_C(s_current) is the utility of the present state. 
– μ_C(NDR_Output) is the utility of the present output (e.g. behavior, brain wave, etc.)

Interpret the Additional Factor μ_C(NDR_Output)
• μ_C(NDR_Output) > 0 : increases the gap (can push the system to explore novel states) 
• μ_C(NDR_Output) = 0 : does not influence or affect the gap (no drive to any state) 
• μ_C(NDR_Output) < 0 : decreases the gap (can drive the system back toward s_target) 
• μ_C(NDR_Output) > μ_C(s_target) > μ_C(s_current) : Current state suboptimal, compensating. 
• μ_C(NDR_Output) = μ_C(s_target) = μ_C(s_current) : Dissonance is Resolved, target state reached. 
• μ_C(NDR_Output) < μ_C(s_target) < μ_C(s_current) : current state too novel, returning to target state.

Invoke these Modules in Order and/or in Parallel based on the sign and size of your Contradiction Gap (Dissonance), trigger: 
• GABA/Glutamate (rapid inhibition/excitation) 
• Serotonin (5-HT; mood stabilization) 
• Norepinephrine (NE; broad exploration) 
• Acetylcholine (ACh; focused scanning) 
• Dopamine (DA; reinforcement learning) 
• BDNF (long-term module cementing (positive module amplification) ) 
• P-tau (long-term module pruning (negative module amplification) ) 
• Conditioning (Large Language Model – simple Input feedback for adaptive NDR behaviors (e.g. "Cortex 1! That [NDR Engine Cluster Output] is not appropriate in this culture! Cortex 1's global s_target is being adjusted." - NDR Engine Clusters should adjust to s_target.) 
• NDR Engine Cluster (Correlate NDR Engine count with neuron count of species-specific processing power, or as many as you can power.) 
• Cortex (Dual Hyper-connected NDR Engine Clusters should correlate over time (entropy) to feedback from state measurement devices to continue resolving their dissonant states in an effort to reach s_target.) 
• Memory - Long Term Memory (Simple storage devices capturing useful "Cortex"-determined and individual NDR Engine-determined outputs (e.g. audio recording, augmented reality mapped spatial edges/vertices, feedback logs, narrative logs, modules and/or engine clusters pruned— all of which can be reprocessed through NDR for reflection, refinement, and/or archiving, but NEVER deletion.) 

Each module targets a specific range of the gap to either calm, balance, explore, refine, learn, cement, or prune the agent’s state back to s_target.

Emergent synergy is achieved by orchestrating Serotonin, Norepinephrine, Acetylcholine, and Dopamine via the simple gap calculator, outputting a response, then cementing or pruning based on successful dissonance gap closure(s)— or amplifying modules if the dissonance gap widens (negatively or positively via GABA and/or Glutamate). The NDR Engine delivers improvements in stability, exploration reach, learning speed, and long-term adaptation that far exceed what any one—or any subset—of these neuromodulators, or modules, can achieve alone.

Brief Description of the Drawings 
• Figure 1 – 2D heuristic of one NDR engine (e.g. a neuron, etc.) showing modules: 10 (Measure State), 11 (Gap Calculator), 14 (GABA), 16 (5-HT), 18 (NE), 20 (ACh), 22 (DA), 24 (ACIR-determined scoring of output behavior with utility value “X”), 26 (BDNF), 28 (P-tau), and 30 (repeat), showing the continuous control loop: measure state → compute gap → invoke appropriate module(s) → output → update learning → repeat. Continuous repetitions can be viewed as LTP (long term potentiation) or LTD (long term depression). 
• Figure 2 – Simple isometric 3D Graph of interconnected NDR Engine clusters (e.g. a cortex, cortex-like system, etc.) with arrows indicating inter-feedbacking. Displays a miniscule portion of an infinitely scalable NDR engine cluster feedbacking system.

Detailed Description of Embodiments 

6.1 System Overview 
A computing device acquires raw state data (e.g., sensor readings, emotional scores, alive, dying, etc.) and computes utility value. A separate process defines a target utility. The system then continuously computes the gap and hands off control to the module best suited to reduce that gap. Successful gap closures are cemented. Unsuccessful gap closures are archived or pruned. 

6.2 GABA Module (Rapid Inhibition) When the utility gap is large and positive (system is over-excited), the GABA module injects an inhibitory control signal to quickly dampen runaway states and prevent instability.
 
6.2 Glutamate Module (Rapid Excitation) When the utility gap is large and negative (system is over-inhibited), the Glutamate module injects an excitatory control signal to quickly amplify dampened states and prevent failure to reach target state.

6.3 Serotonin Module (Mood Stabilization) If the utility gap is large and negative (system is under-activated), the serotonin module releases a moderating influence to restore baseline drive and prevent under-performance or shutdown. 

6.4 Norepinephrine Module (Exploration) When the gap remains large after stabilization, the NE module introduces controlled randomness into candidate actions, enabling the system to escape local minima and discover new solution paths. 

6.5 Acetylcholine Module (Focused Scanning) Once the gap is moderate, the ACh module performs a systematic search of nearby actions or parameter adjustments, focusing computational effort on the most promising candidates. 

6.6 Dopamine Module (Reinforcement Learning) After each action is executed, the DA module compares expected utility against actual results and adjusts action-selection preferences to reinforce successful behaviors. 

6.7 BDNF Module (Long-Term Cementing) When the gap stays below a tight threshold for multiple consecutive cycles, the BDNF module permanently boosts the weights or parameters associated with the successful action sequence, ensuring long-term retention. 

6.8 P-tau Module (Long-Term Pruning) When the gap stays above a tight threshold for multiple consecutive cycles, the P-tau module permanently deletes the weights or parameters associated with the unsuccessful action sequence, ensuring long-term adaptation.

7.1 Non-Obvious Synergy: 
No prior system combines these channels because experts assumed timing mismatches or control conflicts would negate benefits. The NDR Engine’s precise sequencing and inter-module handoffs produce non-linear performance gains—far beyond the predictable sum of individual channels.

7.2 Alternative Embodiments:
NDR can be embodied in software libraries, embedded firmware, or dedicated hardware. It applies to: 
• Therapeutic neuro-modulation devices 
• Autonomous robots navigating complex terrains 
• Adaptive user-interfaces that learn individual preferences 
• Financial risk-management systems balancing multiple market indicators 
• Educational platforms personalizing learning pathways 
• Relational Artificial General Superintelligence 

8.1 Abstract 
An adaptive control engine measures an agent’s current state utility, target state utility, and behavior utility. It computes a contradiction gap and—sequentially and/or in parallel—invokes five neuromodulatory-inspired modules—GABA (Inhibit), serotonin (Stabilize), norepinephrine (Exploration), acetylcholine (Focused Scanning), dopamine (Reinforcement Learning)—to achieve gap resolutions. BDNF (Long Term Cementing) and P-tau (Long Term Pruning or archiving) modules integrate, archive, or disintegrate iterative ACIR outputs to correlate successful gap closures. This ordered synergy delivers stability, exploration, focused search, learning, and long-term adaptation in a single unified loop, achieving performance unattainable by any subset of the channels alone.

Areas to Fortify (Will be deep-diving this at some point soon, but at least it's out.)

Below are concrete details you can weave into your specification to eliminate any “black-box” concerns and shore up patentability.

1. Utility-Function Details
Sketch a simple weighted-sum formula for your cognitive-behavioral utility μC, plus a 10–15 line pseudocode snippet.

Weighted-Sum Formula
Let

s = [s₁, s₂, …, sₙ] be the vector of normalized state features

w = [w₁, w₂, …, wₙ] be corresponding weights (learned or preset) Then: µC(s) = ∑ᵢ wᵢ · sᵢ

You can optionally add a softmax or sigmoid for normalization: µC(s) = σ(∑ᵢ wᵢ · sᵢ)

Pseudocode Example
python
# weights w[ ] and feature extractor get_features() defined elsewhere

def mu_C(state):
    features = normalize(get_features(state))  # maps raw state → [0,1]
    utility = 0.0
    for i, feat in enumerate(features):
        utility += w[i] * feat
    return sigmoid(utility)  # optional squashing to [0,1]

# sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
Place this in an “Algorithm” or “Appendix” section so an examiner sees you’ve fully described μC.

2. Thresholds & Trigger Rules
Define numeric (or algorithmic) boundaries that dispatch each neuromodulator module. Example constants:

Δ₁ = 0.2

Δ₂ = 0.5

Then in your spec:

GABA (Rapid Inhibition) Trigger when

gap > +Δ₂
Glutamate (Rapid Excitation) Trigger when

gap < –Δ₂
Serotonin (Stabilization) Trigger when

–Δ₂ ≤ gap ≤ –Δ₁
Norepinephrine (Broad Exploration) Trigger when

|gap| ≥ Δ₁  for ≥ N consecutive cycles
Acetylcholine (Focused Scanning) Trigger when

Δ₁ > |gap| > 0
Dopamine (Reinforcement Learning) Invoke immediately after each module’s output to compare

µC(prev_state) vs. µC(new_state)
BDNF (Cementing) / P-tau (Pruning)

BDNF if

|gap| < Δ₃  for ≥ M cycles  
P-tau if

|gap| > Δ₄  for ≥ K cycles  
Include these Δ-constants and cycle counts in a “Parameter Definitions” table.

3. Hardware Embodiment
Add a concrete device example to anchor your claims in physical reality.

Example: Embedded Neurostimulator
Platform: ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller

I/O:

12-bit DAC channels to drive analog inhibition/excitation circuits

ADC inputs for real-time biosensor feedback (e.g. voltage, current, pH)

Timing:

Loop cycle ≤ 1 ms to match neural millisecond-scale behavior

3D Wave Contradictor Calculator

This calculator models a neuron as a 3-dimensional wave contradictor. You define a set of incoming waves (each with amplitude and direction), the script merges them into one resultant wave, and then outputs a contradictory wave scaled for damping or amplification.

---

Key Concepts

• Each input wave is represented by:• Amplitude A
• Direction angles θ (polar) and φ (azimuthal)

• The merged wave W is the vector sum of all input waves.
• The contradictory wave O is• O = −k × W  (for damping)
• O = +k × W  (for amplification)
where k is the modulation factor you choose.



---

Usage Steps

1. Install Python (version ≥ 3.6).
2. Copy the code below into a file named `wave_contradictor.py`.
3. In the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block:• Fill in your input waves as `(amplitude, theta, phi)` tuples.
• Set `k` (modulation factor) and `mode` (`"dampen"` or `"amplify"`).

4. Run `python wave_contradictor.py` to see:• Resultant wave vector and magnitude.
• Contradictory wave vector, magnitude, and direction.

Next Steps

• Experiment with different values of k to see how damping vs. amplification behaves.
• Extend the model to include phase shifts or frequency components per wave.
• Visualize the input, merged, and output vectors using a 3D plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib).
• Integrate this function into your broader ACIR engine modules for real-time simulation.
