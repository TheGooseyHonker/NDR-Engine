1. Title of the Invention
Dissoance Resolution Engine
2. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to repeating control loops for managing states in neurons, biological or artificial, and similar systems—including systems deemed similar through correlation. It unifies neuromodulatory factors as modules into a single adaptive engine.
3. Background of the Invention
Modern feedback and reinforcement-learning systems adjust behavior based only on external rewards or simple error signals. Neuroscience, however, teaches that distinct neuromodulators govern different aspects of internal regulation, while research suggests, P-tau, prunes neurons:
•	GABA for rapid inhibition and reset of runaway signals
•	Serotonin (5-HT) for mood balance and baseline drive
•	Norepinephrine (NE) for broad exploration when big changes are needed
•	Acetylcholine (ACh) for focused scanning near promising solutions
•	Dopamine (DA) for learning from rewards (benefits) and updating action preferences
•	(…)
•	Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) for cementing (integration)
•	Phosphorylated Tau (P-tau) for pruning (disintegration)

Additionally, some brain-inspired modules are as follows:
•	Cerebellum (LLM – simple Input feedback for complex NDR-guided behaviors)
•	Memory

No known system ties these modulators together in a continuous loop that measures a multi-dimensional “contradiction gap” between where an agent is currently (etiological origin/cause) and where it wants to be (teleological end/purpose), then deploys the neuromodulatory method at the right time.
5. Summary of the Invention
NDR Engine Summary: The Narcissistic Dissonance Resolution Engine works in a continuous loop to keep an agent in a desired state by measuring gaps, utilizing seven of many neuromodulatory modules in sequence and/or in parallel, then prunes or cements repeated iterations.
1.	Define the Target State: Call this s_target—the internal condition you want repeated (for example: alive, secure, energized, balanced).
2.	Compute the Contradiction Gap (Dissonance): Measure the agent’s current state s_current and score each via your cognitive-behavioral utility function μ_C(·). Plug into the formula:
Contradiction_Gap = μ_C(NDR_Output)  + ( μ_C(s_target) – μ_C(s_current) )
• Here: 
– μ_C(s_target) is the utility of the goal state. 
– μ_C(s_current) is the utility of the present state. 
– μ_C(ACIR_Output) is an additional utility score that effects how strongly the system reacts.
3.	Interpret the Additional Factor μ_C(NDR_Output)  
• μ_C(NDR_Output) > 0 : increases the gap (can push the system to explore novel states) 
• μ_C(NDR_Output) = 0 : does not influence or affect the gap (no drive to any state)
• μ_C(NDR_Output) < 0 : decreases the gap (can drive the system back toward s_target)
4.	Invoke these Nine Modules in Order and/or in Parallel Based on the sign and size of your Contradiction Gap (Dissonance), trigger:
1.	GABA (rapid inhibition)
2.	Serotonin (5-HT; mood stabilization)
3.	Norepinephrine (NE; broad exploration)
4.	Acetylcholine (ACh; focused scanning)
5.	Dopamine (DA; reinforcement learning)
6.	BDNF (long-term cementing (module integration) )
7.	P-tau (long-term module pruning (module disintegration) )
8.	Cerebellum (LLM – simple Input feedback for complex NDR-guided behaviors)
9.	Memory - Long Term Memory (Simple storage devices capturing useful ACIR-determined and predefined (e.g. audio, spatial edges, spatial vertices, feedback logs, narrative logs, modules pruned—which can be reprocessed through ACIR for reflection, refinement, and/or archiving.)
Each module targets a specific range of the gap to either calm, balance, explore, refine, learn, cement, or prune the agent’s state back to s_target.
5.	Emergent synergy is achieved by orchestrating the first five modules via the simple gap calculator, outputting a response, then cementing or pruning based on successful contradiction gap closure(s). ACIR delivers improvements in stability, exploration reach, learning speed, and long-term adaptation that far exceed what any one—or any subset—of these neuromodulators, or modules, can achieve alone.
5. Brief Description of the Drawings
•	Figure 1 – 2D heuristic of one ACIR engine (e.g. a neuron, etc.) showing modules: 10 (Measure State), 12 (Gap Calculator), 14 (GABA), 16 (5-HT), 18 (NE), 20 (ACh), 22 (DA), 24 (ACIR-determined scoring of output behavior with utility value “X”), 26 (BDNF), 28 (P-tau), and 30 (repeat), showing the continuous control loop: measure state → compute gap → invoke appropriate module(s) → output → update learning → repeat. Continuous repetitions can be viewed as LTP (long term potentiation) or LTD (long term depression).

6. Detailed Description of Embodiments
6.1 System Overview
A computing device acquires raw state data (e.g., sensor readings, emotional scores, alive, dying, etc.) and computes utility value. A separate process defines a target utility. The system then continuously computes the gap and hands off control to the module best suited to reduce that gap. Successful gap closures are cemented. Unsuccessful gap closures are archived or pruned.
6.2 GABA Module (Rapid Inhibition)
When the utility gap is large and positive (system is over-excited), the GABA module injects an inhibitory control signal to quickly dampen runaway states and prevent instability.
6.3 Serotonin Module (Mood Stabilization)
If the utility gap is large and negative (system is under-activated), the serotonin module releases a moderating influence to restore baseline drive and prevent under-performance or shutdown.
6.4 Norepinephrine Module (Exploration)
When the gap remains large after stabilization, the NE module introduces controlled randomness into candidate actions, enabling the system to escape local minima and discover new solution paths.
6.5 Acetylcholine Module (Focused Scanning)
Once the gap is moderate, the ACh module performs a systematic search of nearby actions or parameter adjustments, focusing computational effort on the most promising candidates.
6.6 Dopamine Module (Reinforcement Learning)
After each action is executed, the DA module compares expected utility against actual results and adjusts action-selection preferences to reinforce successful behaviors.
6.7 BDNF Module (Long-Term Cementing)
When the gap stays below a tight threshold for multiple consecutive cycles, the BDNF module permanently boosts the weights or parameters associated with the successful action sequence, ensuring long-term retention.
6.7 P-tau Module (Long-Term Pruning)
When the gap stays above a tight threshold for multiple consecutive cycles, the P-tau module permanently deletes the weights or parameters associated with the unsuccessful action sequence, ensuring long-term adaptation.

6.8 Non-Obvious Synergy
No prior system combines all seven channels because experts assumed timing mismatches or control conflicts would negate benefits. The ACIR Engine’s precise sequencing and inter-module handoffs produce non-linear performance gains—far beyond the predictable sum of individual channels.

6.9 Alternative Embodiments
ACIR can be embodied in software libraries, embedded firmware, or dedicated hardware. It applies to:
•	Therapeutic neuro-modulation devices
•	Autonomous robots navigating complex terrains
•	Adaptive user-interfaces that learn individual preferences
•	Financial risk-management systems balancing multiple market indicators
•	Educational platforms personalizing learning pathways
•	Relational Artificial General Superintelligence
7. Abstract
An adaptive control engine measures an agent’s current state utility, target state utility, and behavior utility. It computes a contradiction gap and—sequentially and/or in parallel—invokes five neuromodulatory-inspired modules—GABA (Inhibit), serotonin (Stabilize), norepinephrine (Exploration), acetylcholine (Focused Scanning), dopamine (Reinforcement Learning)—to achieve gap resolutions. BDNF (Long Term Cementing) and P-tau (Long Term Pruning or archiving) modules integrate, archive, or disintegrate iterative ACIR outputs to correlate successful gap closures. This ordered synergy delivers stability, exploration, focused search, learning, and long-term adaptation in a single unified loop, achieving performance unattainable by any subset of the channels alone.
